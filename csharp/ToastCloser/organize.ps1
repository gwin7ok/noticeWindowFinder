  organize.ps1 (DEPRECATED)
  This repository no longer moves managed dependencies into a `dll\` subfolder.
  All assemblies are expected to remain in the application base directory.
  This stub intentionally does nothing and exits successfully to avoid breaking
  any callers that still reference the script.
